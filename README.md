# Use-Phone-Camera-with-Python
I made a simple motion detector program using python and OpenCV, is there a way to access my phone's camera using python and stream the video to my laptop using Bluetooth or a mobile hotspot so I can process the data on my laptop? I'm just using my phone as a detachable camera.
